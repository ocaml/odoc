**odoc** is a powerful and flexible documentation generator for OCaml. It reads *doc comments*, demarcated by `(** ... *)`, and transforms them into a variety of output formats, including HTML, LaTeX, and man pages.

- **Output Formats:** Odoc generates HTML for web browsing, LaTeX for PDF generation, and man pages for use on Unix-like systems.
- **Cross-References:** odoc uses the `ocamldoc` markup, which allows to create links for functions, types, modules, and documentation pages.
- **Link to Source Code:** Documentation generated includes links to the source code of functions, providing an easy way to navigate from the docs to the actual implementation.
- **Code Highlighting:** odoc automatically highlights syntax in code snippets for different languages.

odoc is part of the [OCaml Platform](https://ocaml.org/docs/platform), the recommended set of tools for OCaml.

## Getting Started

To begin using odoc, first install it using opam with the following command:

```
$ opam install odoc
```

Once installed, you can generate your project documentation with [Dune](https://github.com/ocaml/dune):

```
$ dune build @doc
```

Upon completion, you'll find your freshly minted docs in `_build/default/doc/html/index.html`:

```
$ open _build/default/doc/html/index.html
```

For more in-depth information and usage instructions, see the [odoc website](https://ocaml.github.io/odoc).
