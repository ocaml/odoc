# Module `Include_sections`

```
module type Something = sig ... end
```
A module type.

Let's include [`Something`](./Include_sections-module-type-Something.md) once


## Second include

Let's include [`Something`](./Include_sections-module-type-Something.md) a second time: the heading level should be shift here.


### Third include

Shifted some more.

And let's include it again, but without inlining it this time: the ToC shouldn't grow.
