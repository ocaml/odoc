# Module `Markup`

Here, we test the rendering of comment markup.


## Sections

Let's get these done first, because sections will be used to break up the rest of this test.

Besides the section heading above, there are also


### Subsection headings

and


#### Sub-subsection headings

but odoc has banned deeper headings. There are also title headings, but they are only allowed in mld files.


#### Anchors

Sections can have attached [Anchors](./#anchors), and it is possible to [link](./#anchors) to them. Links to section headers should not be set in source code style.


##### Paragraph

Individual paragraphs can have a heading.


###### Subparagraph

Parts of a longer paragraph that can be considered alone can also have headings.


## Styling

This paragraph has some styled elements: **bold** and *italic*, ***bold italic***, *emphasis*, **emphasis* within emphasis*, ***bold italic***, superscript, subscript. The line spacing should be enough for superscripts and subscripts not to look odd.

Note: *In italics *emphasis* is rendered as normal text while *emphasis *in* emphasis* is rendered in italics.* *It also work the same in [links in italics with *emphasis *in* emphasis*.](#)*

`code` is a different kind of markup that doesn't allow nested markup.

It's possible for two markup elements to appear **next** *to* each other and have a space, and appear **next***to* each other with no space. It doesn't matter **how** *much* space it was in the source: in this sentence, it was two space characters. And in this one, there is **a** *newline*.

This is also true between *non-*`code` markup *and* `code`.

Code can appear **inside `other` markup**. Its display shouldn't be affected.

There is no differences between `a b` and `a b`.

Consecutive whitespaces not after a newline are conserved as they are: `a   b`.


## Links and references

This is a [link](#). It sends you to the top of this page. Links can have markup inside them: [**bold**](#), [*italics*](#), [*emphasis*](#), [superscript](#), [subscript](#), and [`code`](#). Links can also be nested *[inside](#)* markup. Links cannot be nested inside each other. This link has no replacement text: [\#](#). The text is filled in by odoc. This is a shorthand link: [\#](#). The text is also filled in by odoc in this case.

This is a reference to [`foo`](./#val-foo). References can have replacement text: [the value foo](./#val-foo). Except for the special lookup support, references are pretty much just like links. The replacement text can have nested styles: [**bold**](./#val-foo), [*italic*](./#val-foo), [*emphasis*](./#val-foo), [superscript](./#val-foo), [subscript](./#val-foo), and [`code`](./#val-foo). It's also possible to surround a reference in a style: **[`foo`](./#val-foo)**. References can't be nested inside references, and links and references can't be nested inside each other.


## Preformatted text

This is a code block:

```ocaml
    let foo = ()
    (** There are some nested comments in here, but an unpaired comment
        terminator would terminate the whole doc surrounding comment. It's
        best to keep code blocks no wider than 72 characters. *)

    let bar =
      ignore foo
```
There are also verbatim blocks:

```
The main difference is these don't get syntax highlighting.
```

## Lists

- This is a
- shorthand bulleted list,
- and the paragraphs in each list item support *styling*.
1. This is a
2. shorthand numbered list.
- Shorthand list items can span multiple lines, however trying to put two paragraphs into a shorthand list item using a double line break
just creates a paragraph outside the list.

- Similarly, inserting a blank line between two list items
- creates two separate lists.
- To get around this limitation, one
  
  can use explicitly-delimited lists.
  
- This one is bulleted,
1. but there is also the numbered variant.
- - lists
  - can be nested
  - and can include references
  - [`foo`](./#val-foo)

## Unicode

The parser supports any ASCII-compatible encoding.

In particuÎ»ar UTF-8.


## Raw HTML

Raw HTML can be <input type="text" placeholder="inserted"> as inline elements into sentences.


    <blockquote>
      If the raw HTML is the only thing in a paragraph, it is treated as a block
      element, and won't be wrapped in paragraph tags by the HTML generator.
    </blockquote>
    

## Math

Math elements can be inline: `\int_{-\infty}^\infty`, or blocks:

```
    % \f is defined as #1f(#2) using the macro
    \newcommand{\f}[2]{#1f(#2)}
    \f\relax{x} = \int_{-\infty}^\infty
    \f\hat\xi\,e^{2 \pi i \xi x}
    \,d\xi
    
```

## Tags

Each comment can end with zero or more tags. Here are some examples:

author antron
deprecated a long time ago
parameter foo unused
raises `Failure` always
returns never
see [\#](#) this url
see `foo.ml` this file
see Foo this document
since 0
before 1\.0 it was in beta
version \-1
```
val foo : unit
```
Comments in structure items **support** *markup*, too.

Some modules to support references.

```
module X : sig ... end
```
```
module Y : sig ... end
```
