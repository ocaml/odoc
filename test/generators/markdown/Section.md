# Module `Section`

This is the module comment. Eventually, sections won't be allowed in it.


## Empty section


## Text only

Foo bar.


## Aside only

Foo bar.


## Value only

```
val foo : unit
```

## Empty section


## within a comment


### and one with a nested section


## *This* `section` **title** has markup

But links are impossible thanks to the parser, so we never have trouble rendering a section title in a table of contents \- no link will be nested inside another link.
