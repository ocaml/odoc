{0 Language Features}

[odoc] works by taking module interfaces, processing them to make them more
useful, and turning them into documentation. This processing is largely {{!hiding}hiding}, handling of {{!canonical}
canonical references}, {{!expansion}expansion} and {{!resolution}resolution}.
This document explains the features of these processes in detail.

{1:hiding Hiding}

Some items are not intended to be used directly but are present as
implementation detail, e.g., for testing, for implementing Dune's namespacing, or other reasons. 

There are two mechanisms for explicitly hiding elements from the final
output. The first is to use {{:https://ocaml.org/manual/ocamldoc.html#ss:ocamldoc-stop}documentation stop comments},
which can be used to hide any items from the output. The second
mechanism is only used for modules and is a naming convention. If any module has a double underscore in its name, it’s considered to be hidden.

{1:canonical Canonical Items}

Occasionally it’s useful to declare an item in one place and expose
it in the public interface in another. In order to prevent unwanted occurrences
of the actual definition site, [odoc] has a feature whereby the 'canonical'
location of a module, module type or type can be specified.

The biggest user of module aliases is Dune's {{:https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/dune-files.html#library}wrapped libraries}.
This feature allows Dune to produce a library whose interface is exposed entirely
though a single top-level module. It does this by mangling the names of the
real implementation modules and generating the single top-level module that
simply contains aliases to the these implementation modules. With [odoc]'s
canonical modules feature all references to the implementation modules are
rewritten to point at the aliases in the top-level module instead. Please
see the section on Dune's 
{{!page-dune.library_wrapping}library wrapping} for more detail.

In a similar fashion, it's sometimes useful to have this feature on module
types and types. For example, [odoc] itself uses this for its 'paths types'.
Since they are all mutually recursive, they all have to be declared at the
same time in the module {{:https://github.com/ocaml/odoc/blob/91f6310967e64f3fa88445f3daf2fea2acc0bb49/src/model/paths_types.ml#L201-L219}[Paths_types]}, but [odoc] exposes them in separate modules.
By annotating the definition point with [@canonical] tags pointing to the
{{:https://github.com/ocaml/odoc/blob/master/src/model/paths.mli#L419}aliases}, we ensure that all their 
references point at the {{!Odoc_model.Paths.Path.Resolved.Module}separate} {{!Odoc_model.Paths.Path.Resolved.ModuleType}modules} as intended.

{1:expansion Expansion}

There are many instances of items in signatures where what's written is
the best thing in terms of semantics, but it’s not necessarily useful in terms
of documentation. For example:

{[
module StringSet : Stdlib.Set.S with type t = string
]}

[odoc] will {e expand} these items, augmenting the declaration with the
signature along with all the documentation comments that can be found, e.g., those from [Stdlib.Set.S] in the above example. While the compiler also does
a very similar procedure and determines the signature of the module,
[odoc] tries quite hard to preserve as much as possible from the original items’ context. 

The declaration can be seen rendered {{!Odoc_examples.Expansion.Simple}here}, 
and the full expansion can be found by clicking on the name of the module
([StringSet] in this case). The direct link is {{!Odoc_examples.Expansion.Simple.StringSet}here}.

These expansions have to be done carefully. A number of cases follow
in which [odoc] has to treat specially.

{2:expansion_aliases Aliases}

In general [odoc] doesn’t expand module aliases unless they are an
alias to a hidden module. If this is the case, the right-hand side of
the declaration is dropped and replaced with [sig ... end], and
the expansion is created.

For example, given the following source,

{[

module Hidden__module : sig
  type t
  val f : t -> t
end

module Alias = Hidden__module

]}

the [Hidden__module] module won’t be present in the output, and
the [Alias] module will be rendered as if it were a simple
signature. This can be seen in the example rendering {{!Odoc_examples.Expansion.Aliases}here}.

As well as expanding aliases to hidden modules, modules are also expanded if the module
alias is "self canonical." That is,
if module [A] is an alias to module [B], that declares [A] to be the canonical
path to the module (i.e., it has the tag [@canonical A] in an associated
comment).

{3 Module Type Aliases}

Module types don’t have aliases in the same way that modules do, but it
is possible and common to declare an effective alias to another by
simply creating a new module type that’s equal to a previous one. For example:

{[
module type A = sig
  type t
end

module type B = A
]}

For these simple module type declarations, where the right-hand side is just a
path, [odoc] treats them as module aliases and doesn’t produce an expansion.
This example is rendered {{!Odoc_examples.Expansion.ModuleTypeAliases}here}.

When strengthening, OCaml turns modules into aliases to the original
module, but nothing is done to module types. In contrast, [odoc] replaces
module types with 'aliases' to the originals, too. These are  not expanded, hence this is important for reducing the size of the output.

The following examples use [module type of struct include ... end] to
obtain the strengthened signature of [A] (see the {{!module_type_of}[Module Type Of]}
section for more details on this).

{[
module A : sig
  module type A = sig type t end
  module X : A
end
module B : module type of struct include A end
]}

OCaml evaluates the following signature for [B]:

{[
module B : sig module type A = sig type t end module X = A.X end
]}

whereas [odoc] internally evaluates this as:

{[
module B : sig module type A = A.A end module X = A.X end
]}

This example is rendered {{!Odoc_examples.Expansion.ModuleTypeAliases2.B}here}


{2 Functors}

When [odoc] encounters a functor, it is also expanded. The parameters
are expanded in the body of the functor expansion, above the signature
representing the functor’s result.

For example, given the following,

{[
module type Argument = sig

  (** This type [a] is declared in the Argument module type *)
  type a

end

module type Result = sig

  (** This type [r] is declared in the Result module type *)
  type r

end

module Functor : functor (X : Argument) (Y : Argument) -> Result
]}

an expansion will be created for [Functor], containing
expansions for [X] and [Y] within it and followed by the [Result]’s signature.
The above functor can be seen rendered {{!Odoc_examples.Expansion.Functors.Functor}here}.

{2 Includes}

If part of your module signature comes from an include of another
module or module type, [odoc] keeps track of this and can render
the included items in a clearly delimited and collapsible way. 
For example, given the following:

{[
module type ToBeIncluded = sig
    type t

    val f : t -> t
    (** The description of [f] *)
end

module A : sig
    include ToBeIncluded

    val g : t -> t
end
]}

The {{!Odoc_examples.Expansion.Include.A}expansion of module [A]} will contain a
clearly demarcated section showing the included items.

If this behaviour is not desired, the include may be inlined with the
tag [@inline] as follows:

{[
module B : sig
    include ToBeIncluded
    (** @inline *)

    val g : t -> t
end
]}

The {{!Odoc_examples.Expansion.Include.B}expansion of module [B]} does not
contain an indication that the elements [t] and [f] came from an [include]
directive.

{2 Shadowing}

OCaml ordinarily does not allow two items of the same type with
the same name. For example, the following is illegal:

{[
type t = int
type t = string
]}

However, if the item comes in via an include, then OCaml allows it.
For example:

{[
module type A = sig
  type t = int
  val f : t
end

module type B = sig
  include A
  type t = string
  val g : t
end
]}

Since [odoc] is required to do its own expansions, it must take
account of this behaviour. The previous example is rendered
{{!Odoc_examples.Expansion.Shadowing}here}.

{2 Deep Equations}

The module type system allows for adding equations to abstract types 
(as seen above in the [StringSet] declaration). These equations
may be 'deep' in the sense that they operate on a nested module
rather than the outer one. For example:

{[
module type SIG = sig
  type t
end

module type MODTYPE = sig
  module X : SIG
  module Y : SIG
end

type foo

module M : MODTYPE with type X.t = foo
]}

Here we've got a module type [SIG] that contains an abstract type [t] and a module type [MODTYPE] that contains two modules, [X] and [Y],
that have signature [SIG]. Lastly, we declare a module [M] that
has signature [MODTYPE] with an additional type equality [X.t = foo].
When the compiler evaluates
the signature of module [M] here, the definition of [X]
within it is simply replaced with a signature:

{[
module M : sig
  module X : sig type t = foo end
  module Y : SIG
end
]}

We lose both the fact that it came from [MODTYPE] and also
that within it, [X] originally had signature [SIG]. [odoc] tries
to be more careful. Instead, it keeps both the [MODTYPE] on [M] with the 
type equality [X.t = foo] 
and the [SIG] on [X] with the type equality [t = foo]. The expansion of
of module [M] in this example can be seen {{!Odoc_examples.Expansion.DeepEquality.M}here}.

Note that if [X] was a simple signature before the type equality was added, that does not get preserved. In the following example,

{[
module type MODTYPE = sig
    module X : sig type t end
    module Y : sig type t end
end

type foo

module M : MODTYPE with type X.t = foo
]}

the {{!Odoc_examples.Expansion.DeepEquality2.M}expansion of M} does not contain any [with type] equations.

{2 Substitution}

Similar to the addition of equations in the previous section, OCaml allows
for types and modules to be {e destructively} substituted, so the
type or module is entirely removed from the resulting signature.

As with the addition of equations above, these substitutions may be on
deeply nested modules, and care needs to be taken to ensure that there are
no references to the removed module or type left. For example:

{[
module type S = sig
  module M: sig type t end

  type t = M.t
end

module type T = S with type M.t := int
]}

The expansion of [T] internally is different from what is rendered.
Internally, it becomes:

{[
module M: sig type t end with type t := int

type t = M.t
]}

From this expansion it is still clear how to resolve the right-hand side
of [type t = M.t], and the next phase of [odoc]'s transformation turns the
right-hand side of [M.t] into [int].

In the output documentation, the declaration of [module M] is rendered
simply as

{[
module M : sig ... end
]}

with the type substitution dropped. This is because the type substitition on
the simple signature isn't useful for the reader; the link [t] would
have no destination. This example is rendered {{!Odoc_examples.Expansion.TypeSubstitution}here}.


{2:module_type_of [module type of]}

The OCaml construct [module type of] allows the type of a module to be
recovered. As usual, when OCaml performs this operation, it only retains
the simplified signature, stripped of comments, includes, and more
complex module type expressions. As with the previous sections, [odoc]
tries a little harder to keep track of these things and also of the
fact that the signature came from a [module type of] expression.

For example, consider the following:

{[
module A : sig

  (** This comment for [type t] is written in module [A] *)
  type t

end

module M : module type of A
]}

the [type t] in module [M] has the comment from the original module.
There is also logic in [odoc] to manage the similar construct
[module type of struct include ... end], which is used where the types
and modules are required to be strengthened. That is, the types in
the signature are equal to those in the original module, and any
modules in the new signature are aliases of those in the original.
For example,

{[
module M' : module type of struct include A end
]}

In {{!Odoc_examples.Expansion.ModuleTypeOf.M}M’}, type [t] is equal to
[A.t], whereas in {{!Odoc_examples.Expansion.ModuleTypeOf.M}M} there is
no equation.

{2 Complications of [module type of]}

Doing the expansion like this comes with some complications, particularly
when the result is further modified. For example, consider this example:

{[
module type S = sig
  module X : sig
    type t
  end

  module type Y = module type of X
  module type Z = module type of struct include X end
end
]}

When OCaml operates on this, it calculates the signature of [S] immediately,
resulting in the module type:

{[
module type S =
  sig
    module X : sig type t end
    module type Y = sig type t end
    module type Z = sig type t = X.t end
  end
]}

whereas [odoc] preserves the fact that [Y] and [Z] are calculated from [X]. If the 
module [X] is subsequently replaced using a destructive substitution on [S], the
results would be different. Given the following,

{[
module X1 : sig
  type t
  type u
end

module type T = S with module X := X1
]}

then the signature of [T] as calculated by OCaml will be

{[
sig
    module type Y = sig type t end
    module type Z = sig type t = X1.t end
end
]}

However, it's clear that if the [module type of] operations were evaluated {e after}
the substitution, both [Y] and [Z] would contain [type u].

There is logic in [odoc] to handle this correctly, but since there is currently no
syntax for representing transparent ascription, the consequence is that we lose
the fact that [Y] and [Z] originally came from [module type of] expressions.

This example is rendered {{!Odoc_examples.Expansion.ModuleTypeOfComplications}here},
and in the {{!Odoc_examples.Expansion.ModuleTypeOfComplications.T}expansion of T}, it
can be seen that [Y] and [Z] are simple signatures only containing [type t].


{1:resolution Resolution}

There are several different but related constructs for referring to elements in
[odoc]. The following example demonstrates each:

{[
(** The module {!module-M} and type {!module-M.module-X.type-t} *)
module M : A.B.C with type X.t = int
]}

Here, [M] is an {e identifier} that uniquely identifies the module [M]. [A.B.C] is a
{e path} used to locate a particular identifier, [X.t] is a {e fragment} that refers
to an element within a module type, and [module-M] and [module-M.module-X.type-t] are
{e references} that are similar to paths in that they are used to locate particular
identifiers; however, unlike paths, they are not checked by the compiler and are entirely
resolved by [odoc].

In most of the output formats, [odoc] supports paths; references and fragments will be
turned into links that take the reader to the referred identifier. These
links need to consider some of the expansions’ features,
as outlined above. In order to decide where the links should point to and how to
turn them into text, a process called 'Resolution' is required.

{2:resolution_aliases Aliases}

Since aliases are not usually expanded, a path or reference to an item contained in
an aliased module must link directly to the item inside the aliased module. For
example:

{[
module A : sig
  type t
end

module B = A

type t = B.t
]}

The right-hand side of [type t] should render as [B.t], but it should link to
the definition of [t] in [module A]. This example is demonstrated {{!Odoc_examples.Resolution.Alias}here}.

Aliases of hidden modules {e are} expanded, so the following example demonstrates
this alteration:

{[
(**/**)

module A : sig
  type t
end

(**/**)

module B = A
  
type t = B.t
]}

Here we've hidden [A] via the {{:https://ocaml.org/manual/ocamldoc.html#ss:ocamldoc-stop}documentation stop comment}
mechanism. This example is demonstrated {{!Odoc_examples.Resolution.HiddenAlias}here}.

{2 Canonical Paths}

When encountering a module, module type, or a type that has been marked with a
[@canonical] tag, [odoc] first has to check that the specified canonical path
actually resolves. If this is the case, in a similar way to the alias above, the
target of the path will be rewritten to point to the canonical path.
However, in contrast to the alias behaviour, the {e text} of the path will
also be rewritten, so it will be as if the canonical path had been written instead
of whatever path was actually there.

For example:

{[
module A : sig
  (** @canonical Odoc_examples.Resolution.Canonical.B *)

  type t
end

module B = A

type t = A.t
]}

Note that in this example the [@canonical] tag has been given the path
[Odoc_examples.Resolution.Canonical.B]. This {e must} be the fully qualified
path to the canonical item.

The right-hand side of [type t] will be rewritten such
that it will be as if [B.t] had been written instead.

Note that canonical tags are only used when resolving {e paths}, not 
fragments (which are relative anyway) nor references. Since they are
written by the author, they’re assumed to point to the correct destination.

{2 Fragment Resolution}

Fragments are relative paths that appear in module type expressions when
adding equations or substituting types or modules. For example:

{[
module type A = sig
  module B : sig
    type t
    val f : t -> t
  end
end

module C : A with type B.t = int
module D : module type of C.B with type t := int
]}

In this expression, the fragment [B.t] should link to the definition of [type t]
inside module [B] inside module [type A]. The fragment [t] in the definition of
module [D] should link to the definition of [type t] inside module [B] inside
module [C]. Note that it can't link to [type t] in [D] since that type has been
destroyed!

This example is rendered {{!Odoc_examples.Resolution.Fragments}here}.

{2 Hidden Elements}

If there are paths that refer to hidden elements, these are removed from the
interface unless there is an equal non-hidden type that can replace it. For
example, in the following type definitions,

{[

(**/**)

type t = int
type u

(**/**)

type v = T of t
type w = U of u

]}

[type v] will have a right-hand side of [T of int], as the hidden [type t] is
equal to [int]; whereas, there is no non-hidden type equivalent to [u], so the
right-hand side of [type w] is omitted from the output.

{2:reference_resolution Reference Resolution}

References are hand-written in comments and not evaluated in any way by the
compiler. 

{[
module type A = sig

  type t
  (** type [t] in module type [A] *)

end

module A : sig

  type t
  (** type [t] in module [A] *)

  module B : sig type t end
  module type B = sig type t end

end

(** We can refer unambiguously to {!module-type-A.t} in module type [A]
    or {!module-A.t} in module [A], and also where there are name clashes
    within the path: {!A.module-B.t} or {!A.module-type-B.t} *)
]}

This demonstrates that it’s possible to refer to elements even when there’s ambiguity,
if just the names were used. If [odoc] detects any ambiguity, it will emit a warning.


{2 Module Type Challenges}

In some cases, resolution can be more challenging than others. Consider this example:

{[
module type A = sig
  module M : sig module type S end
  module N : M.S
end

module B : sig module type S = sig type t end end

module C : A with module M = B with type N.t = int

type t = C.N.t
]}

In the expansion of module type [A], module [N] has no expansion because 
module type [S] is abstract. Therefore, in the definition of module [C], 
the fragment [N.t] cannot link to module [N] in module type [A],
but instead it must link to module type [S] in module [B].

This example is rendered {{!Odoc_examples.Resolution.Complicated_1}here}.

Now for a very complicated example:

{[
module type Type = sig module type T end

module App : functor (T : Type) (F : Type -> Type) (M : F(T).T) -> F(T).T

module Bar : sig module type T = sig type bar end end

module Foo :
  functor (T : Type) -> sig module type T = sig module Foo : T.T end end

module FooBarInt : sig module Foo : sig type bar = int end end

type t = App(Bar)(Foo)(FooBarInt).Foo.bar
]}

This one is left as an exercise to the reader! It can be seen rendered
by [odoc] {{!Odoc_examples.Resolution.Complicated_2}here}.
